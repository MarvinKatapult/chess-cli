# chess-cli
Chess in a command line interface

# How to build
Just start the build.sh script. If you want to generate Doxygen documentation
start the script with the -D flag (You'll have to have Doxygen installed on your system)

# The Idea
Chess-cli is supposed to be a all around chess playing experience
straight in the terminal. Currently the following features are to be
implemented:

- Playing chess with notation on the side
- A Startmenu
- Api to give out available moves for position
- Support for Fenstring
